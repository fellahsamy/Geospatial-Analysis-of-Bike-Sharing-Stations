# Geospatial Analysis of Bike-Sharing Stations
This repository contains a Python script for geospatial analysis and visualization of bike-sharing stations data. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment, specifically Google Colab, and utilizes libraries such as GeoPandas and Contextily.

## Project Description
The project aims to analyze and visualize the geographical distribution and capacity of bike-sharing stations. It uses real-time data to provide insights into the availability and capacity of these stations.

## Features
* Data Visualization: Visualize bike-sharing stations on geographical maps.
* Geospatial Analysis: Perform spatial analysis using GeoPandas.
* Interactive Mapping: Generate interactive maps with Contextily to visualize station locations and capacities.
* Data Integration: Merge and manipulate data from different sources.
## Prerequisites
# Google Colab
# Python Libraries: GeoPandas, Contextily, Pandas, Matplotlib
